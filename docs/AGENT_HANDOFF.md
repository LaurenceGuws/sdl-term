# SDL Term Agent Handoff

## Current Focus

Freeze authority and workflow baseline before implementation execution.

## Read Order

1. `app_architecture/authorities/SCOPE.md`
2. `app_architecture/authorities/MILESTONE.md`
3. `app_architecture/authorities/BOUNDARIES.md`
4. `app_architecture/authorities/NON_GOALS.md`
5. `docs/architect/WORKFLOW.md`
6. `docs/engineer/ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`

## Hard Constraints

- No implementation work starts without a bounded queue.
- Queue work may not violate boundary authority.
- No compatibility/fallback/workaround/shim paths.
